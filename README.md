| [Mushroom Classification](https://github.com/aelluminate/mushroom-classification) | Binary classification model predicts mushroom edibility (poisonous vs. edible) using cleaned UCI dataset. Features include cap diameter, shape, gill attachment, color, etc. Goal: reliable model for mushroom identification. | [ðŸ”— Read more](https://learn.aelluminate.com/projects/machine-learning/mushroom-classification) | [@noeyislearning](https://github.com/noeyislearning) |
| [Breast Cancer Maligancy](https://github.com/aelluminate/breast-cancer-malignancy) | SVM is used to classify human cell records and predict breast cancer malignancy. By training on a dataset of breast cancer features, the goal is to accurately differentiate benign and malignant cases. This research aims to contribute to early detection and diagnosis methods for breast cancer.| [ðŸ”— Read more](https://learn.aelluminate.com/projects/machine-learning/breast-cancer-malignancy) | [@noeyislearning](https://github.com/noeyislearning) |
| [Ease My Trip Flight Price Prediction](https://github.com/aelluminate/ease-my-trip-flight-price-prediction) | Leverages Ease My Trip data, we're building predictive models to estimate flight prices. Factors like airline, class, booking lead time, and others will be analyzed to create a robust framework for understanding flight pricing dynamics. | [ðŸ”— Read more](https://learn.aelluminate.com/projects/machine-learning/ease-my-trip-flight-price-prediction) | [@noeyislearning](https://github.com/noeyislearning) |
| [Ames City House Price Prediction](https://github.com/aelluminate/ames-city-house-price-prediction) | Leverages Ames Housing Price Dataset to create a predictive model for estimating home sale prices in Ames, Iowa. Analyzes property features to understand their impact on sale prices, providing valuable insights for buyers and sellers. | [ðŸ”— Read more](https://learn.aelluminate.com/projects/machine-learning/ames-city-house-price-prediction) | [@noeyislearning](https://github.com/noeyislearning) |
