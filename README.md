Serves as a central platform for showcasing various machine learning projects, examples, and resources. It aims to provide a comprehensive platform for learning, experimenting, and collaborating on all aspects of machine learning.

### Projects

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| [Mushroom Classification](https://github.com/aelluminate/mushroom-classification) | Binary classification model predicts mushroom edibility (poisonous vs. edible) using cleaned UCI dataset. Features include cap diameter, shape, gill attachment, color, etc. Goal: reliable model for mushroom identification. 
| [Breast Cancer Maligancy](https://github.com/aelluminate/breast-cancer-malignancy) | SVM is used to classify human cell records and predict breast cancer malignancy. By training on a dataset of breast cancer features, the goal is to accurately differentiate benign and malignant cases. This research aims to contribute to early detection and diagnosis methods for breast cancer.|
